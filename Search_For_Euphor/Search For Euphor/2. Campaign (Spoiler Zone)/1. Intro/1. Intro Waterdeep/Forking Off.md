If the party decides to fork off on their own, they will be:
	
# Ambushed 
on the road by Demons for sniffing around to 'stop' them from finding a way to [[Euphor]] . This will serve as a hook to either 'curse' them and force them into seeking out [[Chazlov]] or  [[Turlang]], or encourage them to seek their origin and discover the portal they came to this plane on.

# Attacked
If they stay too long in [[Waterdeep]] There will be a demonic attack on the city. The Adventurers may follow the demons into the portal to try and close it, or get dragged in one by one by demons.
